## Prerequisites:
- Installed java (check with ```java -version```). Tested with java version 1.8.0_301.

## Running the example
Run the example using by executing the following command in the **bin** directory:
```
java -jar Simulator.jar
```
Then load the example by clicking ```File < Open``` and selecting **symposium_example_typed.gps**.
We manually transformed the models from Fig. 2 to graph grammars in Groove as described in section VI.

Using the graph grammar, one can generate the state space using Groove (Consult the Groove demos in the further resources section if needed).
The following screenshot illustrates the state space (72 States, 161 transitions) generated by Groove.

## Constraints
The atomic propositions are created in Groove using graph conditions. The constraints are formulated as **LTL properties**.
Right-click on the generated state space and choose ```Verify < Check LTL property (full state space)``` and then copy-paste the constraints listed below to check them.

### Constraint 1 - LTL property:

G(F(end))


### Constraint 2 - LTL property:

!G(r1_accessed_twice_by_1P_2P_r1 | r1_accessed_twice_by_1P_2P_work | r1_accessed_twice_by_2x1P)

Constraint 3 is analog to constraint 2.

**All constraints are fulfilled by the state space,i.e., the models.**
